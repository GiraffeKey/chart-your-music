# ChartYourMusic
 
This project was inspired by [neverendingchartrendering.org](neverendingchartrendering.org). It was created as an open source alternative to the site with additional features and better support. The app is still very open to further development and will likely improve even further in the future. Contributions are appreciated and encouraged.

The site is up and running [here](https://giraffekey.github.io/chartyourmusic/).

## Contributing

There are multiple things you can help with, such as:
- Fixing issues and bugs

- Improving the look and style of the app
- Adding new features and enhancements
- Improving code performance

Just fork the repo and get working!  
Don't want to program? Also consider opening up [issues](https://github.com/GiraffeKey/chartyourmusic/issues) for any bug notifications or suggested features.

## Importing from RateYourMusic

The RYM import functionality can be a little tricky to work with (blame them for it). These steps should help you figure out what to do:
1. Go to the bottom of your RYM profile and click the "Export your data" button.
2. Press CTRL+A CTRL+C to copy all of the text.
3. Create a file on your computer named "rym.csv" and paste the text in it.
4. Go to Import->from RateYourMusic and select the file.

You should see covers for your top rated albums start to load up. You may have to rearrange things or replace a couple covers but it should at least save you some time searching.
