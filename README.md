# ChartYourMusic
 
This project was inspired by [neverendingchartrendering.org](neverendingchartrendering.org). You can use it to create a chart of your favorite things to listen to, download it as an image, and share it with your internet pals!

## Importing from RateYourMusic

The RYM import functionality can be a little tricky to work with (blame them for it). These steps should help you figure out what to do:
1. Go to the bottom of your RYM profile and click the "Export your data" button.
2. Press CTRL+A CTRL+C to copy all of the text.
3. Create a file on your computer named "rym.csv" and paste the text in it.
4. Go to Import->from RateYourMusic and select the file.

You should see covers for your top rated albums start to load up. You may have to rearrange things or replace a couple covers but it should at least save you some time searching.
